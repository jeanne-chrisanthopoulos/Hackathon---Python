The provided code stub reads and integer, n , from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i<n, print i^2.
The first and only line contains the integer, i^2. 

#use input(), whatever the user inputs is returned as a string. 
#use int() to read an integer

n = int(input()) 

#for loop iterates 'i' over the range of numbers from 0 to n-1
#The range() function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) n.
for i in range(n): 
    print(i ** 2)
