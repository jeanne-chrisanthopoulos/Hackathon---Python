Assessing Leap Years:
In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
  The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
  The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
  The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

constrains year >=1900 and <= 10^5

def is_leap(year):
    if year % 4 == 0:  # Checks if the year is evenly divisible by 4, if yes leap
        if year % 100 == 0:  # Checks if the year is evenly divisible by 100, if yes NOT leap
            if year % 400 == 0:  # Checks if the year is evenly divisible by 400, if yes leap
                return True  # If divisible by 400, it's a leap year
            else:  # If divisible by 100 but not by 400, it's not a leap year
                return False
        else:  # If divisible by 4 but not by 100, it's a leap year
            return True
    else:  # If not divisible by 4, it's not a leap year
        return False

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))
